Car Sales Analysis in Python -

Overview -

This project analyzes car sales data using Python. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful insights about car types, horsepower, engine size, and pricing trends.

Dataset -

>>Source: The dataset contains details about various car brands, models, specifications, and sales data.

>>Columns Included:

>>Make (Brand)

>>Model

>>Type (SUV, Sedan, Truck, etc.)

>>Origin (Asia, Europe, USA)

>>DriveTrain (Front, Rear, All-wheel)

>>Price (MSRP & Invoice)

>>Engine Size, Cylinders, Horsepower

>>Mileage (MPG City & Highway)

>>Weight, Wheelbase, Length

Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning -

Removed null values

Fixed incorrect data types (MSRP and Invoice converted from string to numeric values)

Checked and handled duplicate entries
